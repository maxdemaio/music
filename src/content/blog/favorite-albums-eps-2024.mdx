This year I listened to a ton of new music. From unexpected gems to highly anticipated releases, I’ve encountered a wide range of sounds that made 2024 pretty sweet. In this post, I’ll take you through my top 10 favorite albums and EPs of the year, sharing what made each one resonate with me. Stick around for some honorable mentions too!

## 1. Two Star & The Dream Police - Mk.gee

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="6DlLdXBGCsSDPOV8R2pCl7" />

Coming in at number one, Two Star & The Dream Police by Mk.gee. I saw Mk.gee live in September, and it was insane. As a guitarist, I was really intrigued by Mk.gee's tone that everyone is seeking after. For the gearheads out there, here’s a breakdown of some of the main magic behind his setup:

- TASCAM 424 Portastudio: Used almost like a pre-amp, this 4-track recorder adds a distinctive overdrive EQ/fuzz. Played lightly, it’s clean with high headroom; dig in, and the signal distorts and compresses beautifully.
- Rainger FX Reverb-X Pedal: Features a gate that distorts the reverb tails. When he really leans into the strings, the gate opens, unleashing those lush, distorted reverbs.
- Fender Jaguar + Roland GK MIDI Pickup: A combination that delivers unparalleled versatility. I also noticed he’s using flatwound strings - maybe a 7-string flatwound baritone set (minus the high string) with gauges around .065–.015.
- Chorus and Ping Pong Delay FX: These effects contribute to the otherworldly, textured soundscapes throughout the album.

This whole album gives me late 80s vibes. Strange, murky, full of longing, and yet melodic. But I swear the soundspace he creates on his tracks will literally melt your mind. Each track pulls you deeper into his sonic universe. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but it sure is mine!

**Favorite(s)**: New Low, How Many Miles, Are You Looking Up, Candy, Dream Police, Little Bit More

## 2. Requiem - Keshi

Keshi's new album doesn't disappoint. Honestly, I like this one even better than the last, GABRIEL. I saw him perform live back in September of 2022 and I'm very grateful for that!

It's been awesome to see him evolve as an artist. Although I'm a fan of his old sound, he subtly keeps the things I love about his music - emotional high vocals/harmonies, guitars, and crafting lyrics with meaning while capturing the main theme of the album. He even dropped [a video behind the making of the album on his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjtfXkqHnxI)!

**Favorite(s)**: Soft Spot (also the acoustic version is amazing), Like That, Texas, Just to Die

## 3. Dunya - Mustafa

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="16sGrLUTzqz0Z43j9qMn8S" />

I hadn't heard of Mustafa before this year. The poetry, stringed instruments, vocals, and religious concepts are what drew me into this album. Specifically, I enjoyed the use of the oud across many songs on the album. Alongside guitars and light soothing vocals, the traditional instruments give the listener an auditory peek into Mustafa's childhood.

Favorite(s): Name of God, Imaan, Leaving Toronto

## 4. Amy - Yana

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="16ZKxf5jDH2L7UIQ19uNIz" />

Banjo? Rich, resonant, and rhythmic acoustic guitar? Amazing wispy stacked vocal harmonies? This EP snuck onto my list when it dropped in October. The bass and percussion really bring everything together and make all the songs feel full too.

**Favorite(s)**: How Long, Haunt Me, Call Me Back

## 5. Radical Optimism - Dua Lipa

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="1Mo92916G2mmG7ajpmSVrc" />

The production value on this album is insane. The mellow beach disco vibes had me replaying songs quite a bit. This year, she even performed a [Tiny Desk concert](https://youtu.be/y38qQRg3UDI?si=VA5yRQEyAsyH7Mdi), featuring select songs from the album! Personally, I really like artists who are talented musicians and sound great live/stripped down outside of the studio. She is one of them! Her music feels like a breath of fresh air compared to other pop contemporaries.

**Favorite(s)**: Happy For You, Houdini, Illusion, These Walls

## 6. Unfold - Kanako Yamamoto

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="2fWAJ4ENbB3iRKsfOMKmn2" />

Leading tones, open strings, cool tunings, and a tie back to her beginnings with the guzheng. This EP has such a cool soundscape and I really loved all the songs on this EP. This EP captures who Kanako is as an artist and multi-instrumentalist.

**Favorite(s)**: Unfold, Intentional, The Rain Song

## 7. TFL Blues - Zino Vinci

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="7rF4TnnZS0QimTQRJHfFLg" />

This EP paints the picture of hopping on a train and traveling through emotions: sadness, joy, sorrow, grief, jealousy, and finally arriving at happiness. I had never heard of this artist before, but as an avid Jim Legxacy fan, I heard about them through one of Jim's Instagram stories.

**Favorite(s)**: Cracked Oyster

## 8. Charm - Clairo

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="1KNUCVXgIxKUGiuEB8eG0i" />

Kick back and listen to this album on a nice walk, at the grocery store, or at home! Hazy, dreamy, laid back, and yet the melodies are laser focused.

**Favorite(s)**: Add Up My Love, Sexy to Someone, Thank You

## 9. Heavy Kinda Feeling - Henry Patterson

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="09aNITIqqQVM6WDtLq1UPA" />

The debut EP of Henry Patterson really captured who they are as an artist. I find new music sometimes through Instagram, and from the get go his fluttery voice and talent as a musician caught my eye/ear. Really excited to see what he does next!

**Favorite(s)**: Buzzcut, The Joke, I Dare You, Heavy Kinda Feeling

## 10. DOA - ericdoa

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="75ScphmWaaBgNOTUh4fatP" />

In your face vocals, great production, and rock/pop/glitchy/hyperpop tracks juxtaposed with trap-like drums and booming bass. This album is super catchy and I really enjoyed the various nuances across each song that made them wholly unique.

**Favorite(s)**: the cake is a lie, dancinwithsomebawdy, paystub, lastjune
