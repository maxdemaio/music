This post will detail all my favorite albums I came across this year. Also, I couldn't narrow it down to a top ten, so you're getting a top twelve. Yeah, I said it!

This year I've listened to a ton of new music. I really like artists who are talented musicians and sound great live/stripped down outside of the studio. 

Spotify Wrapped is sweet each year, but I feel like that didn't encapsulate my favorite albums. P.S. if you'd like to check out your top songs/artists whenever, please check out my app that I made! - [https://splist.fm](https://splist.fm)!

## 1. Two Star & The Dream Police - Mk.gee

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="6DlLdXBGCsSDPOV8R2pCl7" />

Coming in at number one, Two Star & The Dream Police by Mk.gee. I saw this dude live in September, and it was insane. As a guitarist, I was really intrigued by Mk.gee's tone that everyone is seeking after. For the guitar nerds out there, the main components of this involve:

- 4 track TASCAM 424 Portastudio, he almost uses this as a pre-amp overdrive EQ/fuzz. If you play lightly, it's clean with high headroom, but if you dig in, it distorts and compresses the signal.
- Rainger FX Reverb-X Pedal with a gate on it to distort the reverb tail (When he digs in the gate opens as does all the distorted reverb tails)
- Fender Jaguar + a Roland GK MIDI pickup ran into a Roland VG8 Guitar Synth processor. The patch used sounds like a nylon string guitar patch for "Are you looking up" and probably the "VeryEFX" patch for the tones from "Candy" and a few others.
  - Also, I noticed he's using flatwound strings. This is likely a 7 string flatwound baritone set with the high string omitted. Something along the lines of .065 - .015 gauge flatwound string set. Lots of things going on here that add to the sauce.
- Chorus and some sort of stereo ping-pong delay

This whole album gives me late 80s vibes. Strange, murky, full of longing, and yet melodic. But I swear the soundspace he creates on his tracks will literally melt your mind. Not everyone's cup of tea, but it sure is mine!

Favorite(s): New Low, How Many Miles, Are You Looking Up, Candy, Dream Police, Little Bit More

## 2. Requiem - Keshi

Keshi's new album doesn't disappoint. Honestly, I feel like I like this one even better than. I saw him live back in September of 2022, 

## 3. Dunya - Mustafa

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="16sGrLUTzqz0Z43j9qMn8S" />

I hadn't heard of Mustafa before this year. The poetry, stringed instruments, vocals, and religious concepts are what drew me into this album. Specifically, I enjoyed the use of the oud across many songs on the album. Alongside guitars and subtle vocals, the oud gives the listener an auditory peek into Mustafa's childhood.

Favorite(s): Name of God, Imaan, Leaving Toronto

## 4. Radical Optimism - Dua Lipa

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="1Mo92916G2mmG7ajpmSVrc" />

Production value is insane. Then, she even did a [Tiny Desk concert](https://youtu.be/y38qQRg3UDI?si=VA5yRQEyAsyH7Mdi) this year too with select songs from the album!

## 5. ten days - Fred again..

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="3DQueEd1Ft9PHWgovDzPKh" />


## 6. Unfold - Kanako Yamamoto

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="2fWAJ4ENbB3iRKsfOMKmn2" />

Leading tones open strings, 

## 7. open this wall - berlioz

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="1NjMj1u1EQxn8oESg40bPA" />

## 8. Amy - Yana

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="16ZKxf5jDH2L7UIQ19uNIz" />

Banjo? Rich, resonant, and rhythmic acoustic guitar? Amazing wispy stacked vocal harmonies? This EP snuck onto my list when it dropped in October. The bass and percussion really bring everything together and make all the songs feel full too.

Favorite(s): How Long, Haunt Me, Call Me Back

## 9. TFL Blues - Zino Vinci

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="7rF4TnnZS0QimTQRJHfFLg" />

This EP paints the picture of hopping on a train and traveling through emotions: sadness, joy, sorrow, grief, jealousy, and finally arriving at happiness. I had never heard of this artist before, but as an avid Jim Legxacy fan, I heard about him through one of Jim's Instagram stories.

Favorite(s): Cracked Oyster

## 10. Charm - clairo

<SpotifyEmbed albumId="1KNUCVXgIxKUGiuEB8eG0i" />

Kick back and listen to this album on a nice walk or at home! Hazy, dreamy, laid back, and yet the melodies are lazer focused.

## 11. Heavy Kind of Feeling - Henry Patternson
