## Writing a song

**If something comes to your mind, write it down. This could be at any time of the day, any place, or anywhere.**

Songwriting is a skill you build up through lots of practice. There is no perfect song or perfect way to write something, just be happy if you have something unique that you’re proud of.

- Start with a little tune
- Can start usually on a verse or a chorus, then try and go with the tune that you like that's in your head and definitely record early
- Doesn't have to be fully fleshed out lyrics, can just be humming along
- Go back and see what words fit, almost like a puzzle
- Look up rhymes, near rhymes, use a thesaurus, or even use ChatGPT to help
- Go with your gut instinct in beginning, then later go back and iterate
- Write for yourself, don't write for others
- Pop setup: Verse 1, Prechorus Chorus, Verse 2, Prechorus, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus

1. Write down words of how you are feeling (Ex. Alone)
2. Write words next to it that rhyme with that word (It has to make sense tho) (Ex. Own)
3. Basically just make something outta that (You left me here all on my own, baby I've been feeling so alone)

### Be specific

- The way a thing looks
- The way someone walks
- Time of day

We can revert back to 5 senses

1. eyesight
2. hearing
3. taste
4. touch
5. smell

> there’s no one here

vs

> open roads not a soul around
> loud winds and the silence of this town
> nothing but chills running down my spine

(eyesight, hearing, touch)

### Read and write poetry

Turning simple things into interesting stories. It helps to look at lyrics the way you’d look at words in a poem. Personally, I like to look at [the poem of the day](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/poem-of-the-day) and I'll write down phrases I really like.

1. What literary devices can I use?
    1. metaphors, similes, repetition, imagery, alliteration, etc…
2. Can I change the poetic form or rhyming schemes?

### Cherry Wine by Hozier (example)

> Her eyes and words are so icy (metaphor)
> Oh but she burns (contrast)
> Like rum on the fire (simile)
> Hot and fast and angry as she can be
> I walk my days on a wire (metaphor)

### Give yourself limitations

- Certain amount of syllables to use
- Word bank
- Start every line with a different letter
- Etc, up to you

This helps you limit choices and let’s you be creative to make things work.

### Readings and analysis

For songs you like, highlight the lyrics that stand out and ones that are forgetful. **The way to improve your writing is to read first**.

### Expose yourself to different styles

Step out of comfort zone and listen to a new genre for different writing styles and influences. This could be in music or literature.

### Practice example: Writing a 3rd verse to an already existing song

Keep the melody of an already existing song (of an original or a cover) and then add your own verse. This is good practice!

### Be honest

- songs can be stories and experiences
    - people relate to ones that are honest and vulnerable

### Write bad lyrics

- Flesh out all bad lyrics and stories so you can get better

## Analyzing the lyrics

Go through whole song reading/singing lyrics. Take note of what feels good and what needs work. Ask the question, “am I really saying what I want to say?” Look closely at the lyrics and then ask “am I saying what I want to as clearly as I’d like to?” Nothing wrong with going back through the song and editing it multiple times. You don’t have to nail it the first time.

This lets you become more aware of how you write: This allows you to start identifying your stylistic habits, strengths, and areas for improvement.
