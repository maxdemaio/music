I thought I'd make a post detailing my favorite guitar picks. This way, I can have it documented which ones I prefer and why.

## Electric guitar picks

Keep in mind, sometimes I don't even play with a pick. But when I do here are my picks:

- Starting things off, I really like the 2.0mm gator grip pick from Jim Dunlop. To quote their website, this pick offers "superior playing control and a dark, beefy sound. A matte surface allows for a tight, nonslip grip, and a molded, beveled edge provides for a smooth attack and a soft release so you can play with unimpeded intensity and dexterity."

- Next, you can't possibly go wrong picking from Jim Dunlop's classic Tortex picks. As of this post they have 0.5, .60, .73, .88, 1.0, and 1.14mm picks. From these I personally prefer the .60mm (orange) or the .73mm (yellow) picks. I remember my first guitar teacher, Lee Durant, used to play with the .60mm picks all the time. So, those ones are quite nostalgic.

## Acoustic guitar picks

Note, when I play acoustic guitar I don't really play with a pick either. But here are my picks:

- Jim Dunlop gels yellow extra heavy pick - https://www.jimdunlop.com/gels-yellow-extra-heavy-pick/

- If I'm going with a thin pick, which I usually don't, I'll go with a Guild triangular thin pick.


## Conclusion

There are so many guitar picks available in all shapes, sizes, and materials. Honestly the sky is the limit. Ultimately it comes down to personal preference. I'll probably update this list if I do find more I like in the future.
