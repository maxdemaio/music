      <Quote authorAndSource="Braden Bales - A GOOD GOODBYE">
        I wasted my youth on a life without truth, I’m<br /> just as fake as my promises<br
        />A slight tinge of blue in mind that’s old news, I<br />used to be such
        an optimist<br />...<br />I picture my stained glass seat as you file
        down<br />And pay dues to my pinewood house<br />I can see that the pain
        won’t leave if I do right now<br />It’s passed around

      <Quote authorAndSource="Tracy K. Smith - Watershed">
        the rippling shallow water<br />the white ash trees shedding their
        leaves

      <Quote authorAndSource="Taha Muhammad Ali - Meeting at an Airport">
        my blood rushing<br />like the shadow<br />cast by a cloud of starlings
      </Quote>
      <Quote authorAndSource="Marge Piercy - The birthday of the world">
        On the birthday of the world<br />I begin to contemplate<br />what I
        have done and left<br />undone, but this year<br />not so much
        rebuilding<br />of my perennially damaged<br />psyche, shoring up
        eroding<br />friendships, digging out<br />stumps of old resentments<br
        />that refuse to rot on their own
      </Quote>
      <Quote authorAndSource="Steinza - Visions of You">
        every night I paint the back of my<br />closed up eyelids and see the
        past - I get<br />visions of you that I can’t unsee - and I’m<br />I’m
        all black and blue - but i’ll<br />make believe that I’m -<br />fine ok<br
        />that I’m doing great
      </Quote>
      <Quote authorAndSource="Effy Marella - Bleachers">
        talk all the shit you want <br />call me when you’re drunk and lonely<br
        />I’ll always pick up<br />but I should make it hard to reach me<br
        />talk all the shit you want<br />say what you’re gonna say about me<br
        />I’ll still cheer you on<br />but you won’t see me in the bleachers

      <Quote authorAndSource="Jim Legxacy - old place">
        We used to feel rest in each other's presence<br>
        But now we wait on karma to strike each other<br>
        And we light another useless flame<br>
        To try, ignore how I and you, would the love company of fools<br>
        But we were the fools, tied in a race<br>
        But if you would<br>
        I'll give you your old place back

      <Quote authorAndSource="TJ Minor - Narcissist">
        The moment I died is when I seen<br>
        I loved you more than you loved me<br>
        You moved on quick so I guess I need<br>
        To light one up so I can forget you
